    "# Case Study 2.1. Classifying EuraSat images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a type of artificial neural network that are designed to work with grid-structured data, such as an image, a speech signal, or a video. They are particularly effective for image and video classification, object detection and recognition, and natural language processing tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key components of a CNN are convolutional layers, activation functions, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Convolutional layers: Convolutional layers are the building blocks of a CNN. They perform a convolution operation on the input data, where a small matrix (known as a filter or kernel) is moved across the input data, element-wise multiplication is performed between the elements of the filter and the input data, and then the results are summed up to produce a single output value. This process is repeated for every possible position of the filter, resulting in a set of outputs, called feature maps. Convolutional layers can extract features from the input data, such as edges, shapes, textures, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Activation functions: Activation functions are used to introduce non-linearity into the network. They are applied element-wise to the output of the convolutional layer. The most commonly used activation functions in CNNs are Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) and sigmoid.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Pooling layers: Pooling layers are used to reduce the spatial size of the feature maps, making the network less computationally expensive and more robust to changes in the position of objects in the input data. There are several types of pooling, including max pooling and average pooling. In max pooling, the maximum value in a region of the feature map is taken as the output, while in average pooling, the average value in a region is taken as the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Fully connected layers: The fully connected layers are used to make the final prediction using the features extracted by the convolutional and pooling layers. They perform a weighted sum of the inputs, followed by a non-linear activation function, and then produce the final output of the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The architecture of a CNN can be designed for a specific task by choosing the number of convolutional and fully connected layers, the size of the filters, the type of activation functions, and the type of pooling. The weights of the filters and the biases of the fully connected layers are learned from the training data using an optimization algorithm, such as stochastic gradient descent or Adam.\n",

The batch size can be decided according to memory capacity, generally, it takes in power of 2. For example, the batch size can be 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, etc.\n"
