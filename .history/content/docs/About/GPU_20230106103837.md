## Introduction 

Over the past few decades, social science research has faced challenges due to a lack of available data, the cost and time needed to conduct surveys, and limitations on computational power for analysis. These issues were exacerbated by declining survey quality and biases in the characteristics of respondents. There was also no guarantee that long-term, time-consuming surveys would continue to be available due to fiscal austerity (Singleton et al., 2017). However, in recent years, the availability of big data has greatly expanded the resources available to social scientists, allowing them to access a wide range of information about individuals and societies from sources such as social media, mobile devices, and online transactions. The rapid expansion of data is transforming the practice of social science, providing increasingly granular profiles about the society. The difference is not just a matter of scale. The increasing data availability extends beyond the realm of identifying consumer preferences, allowing us to measure social processes and the dynamics of spatial trends in unprecedented detail. 

For example, Trasberg and Cheshire (2021) used a large scale mobility data from mobile applications to explore the activity patterns in London during lockdown, identifying the socio-spatial fragmentation between urban communities. Similarly, Van Dijk (2020) used an annually updated Consumer Register (LCR) to estimate residential moves and the socio-spatial characteristics of the sedentary population in the UK, overcoming the limitations of the traditional census data. Gebru et al. (2020), on the other hand, used a large scale dataset of images from Google Street View to estimate the demographic makeup of a neighborhood. Their results suggested a possibility of using automated systems for monitoring demographics may effectively complement labor-intensive approaches, with the potential to measure demographics with fine spatial resolution, in close to real time.

With the growing availability of data, processing and analyzing large datasets need more computational power than is currently available, with more complex algorithms that need more compute power to run. To overcome this challenge, researchers have turned to a GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) to accelerate massive data parallelism and computation. Therefore, in this chapter, we will introduce the concept of GPU and explain why GPU can be a useful tool for social scientists. In addition, we will provide a brief introduction to the CUDA and RAPIDS package, which is a GPU-accelerated framework that can be used to accelerate the data analysis process. 

## CPU vs GPU 

CPU (Central Processing Unit) is the main processing unit of a computer. Constructed from millions of transistors, the CPU can have multiple processing cores and is commonly referred to as the brain of the computer. It is essential to all modern computing systems as it executes the commands and processes needed for your computer and operating system. GPU (Graphics Processing Unit), on the other hand, has many smaller and more specialized cores. It is designed for rapidly manipulating and altering memory to accelerate graphics workloads, but since the early 2010â€™s, GPUs can also be used to accelerate calculations involving massive amounts of data. 

The main difference between CPU and GPU is the designed architecture (Figure 1). CPU is designed for sequential tasks, while GPU is designed for parallel tasks. CPU has a few strong cores, while GPU has many weak cores. CPU has a high clock speed, which is used to execute instructions, while GPU has a high floating-point performance, which is used to perform mathematical calculations.

One simple analogy that explain the difference between CPU and GPU is that CPU is like a Gru (from Despicable Me) who is a 

 that can be used to explain the difference between CPU and GPU is that CPU is like a brain, which has a few strong cores, while GPU is like a soul, which has many weak cores. 



## What is a GPU?

[GPU](https://www.zhihu.com/question/319355296)

- GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) is a specialized electronic circuit designed to rapidly manipulate and alter memory to accelerate the creation of images in a frame buffer intended for output to a display device. 
- GPUs are used in embedded systems, mobile phones, personal computers, workstations, and game consoles. 
- Modern GPUs are very efficient at manipulating computer graphics and image processing, and their highly parallel structure makes them more effective than general-purpose CPUs for algorithms where processing of large blocks of data is done in parallel. 

GPU vs CPU 
- CPU is like a brain, which has a few strong cores, while GPU is like a soul, which has many weak cores.
- GPU has a large number of cores, which are small processors that can run in parallel.
- GPU has a large amount of memory, which is used to store data and instructions.
- GPU has a high bandwidth, which is used to transfer data between the GPU and the CPU.
- GPU has a high clock speed, which is used to execute instructions.
- GPU has a high floating-point performance, which is used to perform mathematical calculations.

CUDA 
- First released in 2007, the parallel computing platform lets coders take advantage of the computing power of GPUs for general purpose processing by inserting a few simple commands into their code.

## Is GPU better than CPU?
Yes and no 

**Function** 
- CPU is better at sequential tasks, optimized for single-threaded applications.

- We need to understand the bottleneck of GPU and CPU. 
- GPU is better than CPU when we have a lot of data and we need to do a lot of calculations.
- CPU is better when we are doing a lot of sequential tasks on a small amount of data.

But is it really necessary to use GPU for every task?

It depends on the data science project. You need to consider the tradeoffs between speed, reliability, and cost.
You may get away without a GPU if your neural network is small in scale.
It might be worthwhile to consider investing in a GPU if the neural network of a data scientist includes tons of calculations involving hundreds of thousands of parameters.
Typically GPUs are a better bet for fast machine learning since, at its core, data science model training comprises simple matrix math calculations, the speed of which is enhanced when performed in parallel.

## Choosing the right GPU for your analysis

GPU can be expensive. So, it is important to choose the right GPU for your analysis. 
**Local GPU**
- Not all GPU has the same performance. 
- Not all GPU can be intergrated with the CUDA toolkit.
- For example M1 chips are not compatible with CUDA toolkit.

**Cloud GPU**
- Cloud GPU is a good choice for GPU computing.
- Cloud GPU is cheaper than local GPU.
- Providers: Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, IBM Cloud, Oracle Cloud, Alibaba Cloud, Tencent Cloud, etc.
