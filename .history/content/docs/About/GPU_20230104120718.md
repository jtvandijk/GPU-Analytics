## Introduction 

For the past few decades, empirical work in the social sciences has been defined by scarcity. Data were hard to acquire, surveys were costly to conduct, and the computational power to analyze data was limited. The consequence of this scarcity were exacerbated by the diminishing quality of social surveys where acceptable response rates are not achieved, or there is bias in the relevant characteristics of those that respond to those that do not. Moreover, there is also no guarantee that we will be able to rely on the long-term availability of those time-consuming surveys that have come under increasing pressure with fiscal austerity (Singleton et al., 2017). 

However, social scientists are now in an era of data abundance. New sources of Big Data are becoming available in ever greater variety and volume - from store loyalty card transactions, social media posts, mobile phone data or smart energy meter readings. The rapid expansion of data is transforming the practice of social science, providing increasingly granular profiles about the society. The difference is not just a matter of scale. The increasing data availability extends beyond the realm of identifying consumer preferences, allowing us to measure social processes and the dynamics of spatial trends in unprecedented detail. 

For example, retail geographers are using store loyalty card data to measure human activity spaces (i.e., the choice of routes through time a)



 Retail geographers, for example, are now able to track the movement of consumers in real time using mobile phone data (Batty et al., 2015). Mobility geographers, meanwhile, are able to track the removal of social media posts in real time using Twitter data (Batty et al., 2017). Consumer Register (LCR) data, which is used to track the movement of consumers in the UK, is now available in a more detailed form than ever before (Batty et al., 2018).




In recent years, social scientists are now in an era of data abundance. New sources of Big Data are becoming available in ever greater var.

The rapid expansion of available data has shifted the evidence base. Retail geographers ... Mobility geographers..., Consumer Register (LCR)  ...

The difference is not just a matter of scale. New forms of data can fundamentally change our ability to measure phenomena; for example, tracking the removal of social media posts in real time provides a new window into how authoritarian regimes control information available to the public. Computing power has also exploded, with personal computers able to analyze millions of rows of data and more powerful cloud computing services readily available.


Social scientists increasingly rely on machine learning methods to make the most of this new abundance of data.

From scientific discovery to artificial intelligence, high performance computing (HPC) is an important pillar
that facilities the advancement of technology and science. 

. Modern HPC data centers are currently solving some of the greatest challenges facing the world today With traditional CPUs no longer delivering the performance gains they used to, the path forward for HPC data centers is GPUaccelerated computing.  


1. Prepared for the new generation of HPC applications 
2. Top Applications are accelerating with GPUs
3. Boost your productivity and performance with GPUs

## What is a CPU?

## What is a GPU?

[GPU](https://www.zhihu.com/question/319355296)

- GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) is a specialized electronic circuit designed to rapidly manipulate and alter memory to accelerate the creation of images in a frame buffer intended for output to a display device. 
- GPUs are used in embedded systems, mobile phones, personal computers, workstations, and game consoles. 
- Modern GPUs are very efficient at manipulating computer graphics and image processing, and their highly parallel structure makes them more effective than general-purpose CPUs for algorithms where processing of large blocks of data is done in parallel. 

GPU vs CPU 
- CPU is like a brain, which has a few strong cores, while GPU is like a soul, which has many weak cores.
- GPU has a large number of cores, which are small processors that can run in parallel.
- GPU has a large amount of memory, which is used to store data and instructions.
- GPU has a high bandwidth, which is used to transfer data between the GPU and the CPU.
- GPU has a high clock speed, which is used to execute instructions.
- GPU has a high floating-point performance, which is used to perform mathematical calculations.

CUDA 
- First released in 2007, the parallel computing platform lets coders take advantage of the computing power of GPUs for general purpose processing by inserting a few simple commands into their code.

## Is GPU better than CPU?
Yes and no 

**Function** 
- CPU is better at sequential tasks, optimized for single-threaded applications.

- We need to understand the bottleneck of GPU and CPU. 
- GPU is better than CPU when we have a lot of data and we need to do a lot of calculations.
- CPU is better when we are doing a lot of sequential tasks on a small amount of data.

But is it really necessary to use GPU for every task?

It depends on the data science project. You need to consider the tradeoffs between speed, reliability, and cost.
You may get away without a GPU if your neural network is small in scale.
It might be worthwhile to consider investing in a GPU if the neural network of a data scientist includes tons of calculations involving hundreds of thousands of parameters.
Typically GPUs are a better bet for fast machine learning since, at its core, data science model training comprises simple matrix math calculations, the speed of which is enhanced when performed in parallel.


## Why GPU is becoming popular - CUDA 



## How can we use GPU for social and geographical analysis? 
- The advent of consumer data has led to the development of new methods for social and geographical analysis.
- 5V (Volume, Velocity, Variety, Veracity, and Value) 
- It requires modern computing infrastructure to process and analyze the data.
- GPU is a good choice for social and geographical analysis.

Examples of social and geographical analysis
- Social network analysis
- Geospatial analysis
- Text mining
- Image processing
- Machine learning

## What are the tools available for using GPU?

- RAPIDS
- TensorFlow
- PyTorch
- Numba
- CuPy
- PyCuda
- PyMC3 

## Choosing the right GPU for your analysis

GPU can be expensive. So, it is important to choose the right GPU for your analysis. 
**Local GPU**
- Not all GPU has the same performance. 
- Not all GPU can be intergrated with the CUDA toolkit.
- For example M1 chips are not compatible with CUDA toolkit.

**Cloud GPU**
- Cloud GPU is a good choice for GPU computing.
- Cloud GPU is cheaper than local GPU.
- Providers: Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, IBM Cloud, Oracle Cloud, Alibaba Cloud, Tencent Cloud, etc.
