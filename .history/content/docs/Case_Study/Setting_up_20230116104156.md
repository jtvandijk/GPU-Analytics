## Introduction 
Setting up the environment for GPU can be challenging, as every computer has different hardware and software configurations. There are no universal instructions that will work for everyone, but in this chapter, we will discuss how to set up the environment for GPU in local-host and Google Colab. We will also highlight the steps to verify that the GPU is working properly. 


## Setting up the environment for Google Colab GPU 

Google Colab is a cloud-based platform that allows you to run Jupyter notebooks in the cloud, with support for running on GPUs. Google Colab already pre-installed libraries such as pandas or NumPy, so you do not need to run “pip install” by yourself. Here are the steps to set up a GPU for use in Colab:

### How to Start? 

The first step is to create a new notebook in Google Colab. You can do this by going to the (Google Colab website)[https://colab.research.google.com/], signing in with your Google account, and creating a new notebook.

### Enabling GPU support in Google Colab 

After creating a new notebook, you need to enable GPU support. To do this, go to the "Runtime" menu and select "Change runtime type." Then, set the "Hardware accelerator" to "GPU."

After you change your runtime type, your notebook will restart, which means information from the previous session will be lost.

You may also see the TPU option in the drop-down menu. TPU stands for a Tensor Processing Unit, which is a specialized chip designed to accelerate machine learning workloads. TPU is more powerful than GPU, but it is also more expensive.

### Verify GPU access 

After you enable GPU support, you can verify that the GPU is working properly by running the following code in a code block in your notebook.


```Python
!nvidia-smi
```



\\code block 

https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1P7okDVh6viCIOkii6UAF2O9sTAcKGNWq#scrollTo=hauEP36SOK6d


import tensorflow as tf
print("Num GPUs Available: ", len(tf.config.experimental.list_physical_devices('GPU')))
This should print "Num GPUs Available: 1" if a GPU is available.

Import the deep learning library you need, such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, Caffe or others

Check GPU's usage in the Colab, there is a option in the top right corner to check the GPU usage.

And, now you are ready to use your GPU power in the Colab, you can run all the deep learning codes and it will use the GPU power.
It's worth mentioning that Colab is also providing TPU, Tensor Processing Unit for more computational power.
